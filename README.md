# Online Food Delivery Analysis

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshan24byte/online-food-dataset/data)

This project focuses on constructing an efficient data pipeline using Apache Airflow and creating visualizations using Kibana to analyze the demographic of customers in an online food delivery service. The objective is to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth through data-driven decision-making.

## Overview

The project involves the following key components:

1. **Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow**:
   - Construction of a robust data pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process of customer demographic data.
   - Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) are utilized to define workflows and dependencies, ensuring data processing tasks are executed efficiently and reliably.

2. **Data Visualization with Kibana**:
   - Creation of insightful visualizations using Kibana to explore and analyze customer demographic data.
   - Kibana dashboards provide interactive visualizations and data exploration tools to derive actionable insights from the analyzed data.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

- **Optimize Operations**: Analyze customer demographic data to identify patterns and trends, enabling the optimization of operational processes such as delivery routes, inventory management, and resource allocation.

- **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Gain insights into customer preferences, behavior, and satisfaction levels to tailor services and offerings to meet customer expectations effectively.

- **Drive Business Growth**: Utilize data-driven decision-making to identify opportunities for expansion, target new customer segments, and enhance marketing strategies, ultimately driving business growth and profitability.

## Components

1. **Apache Airflow**:
   - Defines and orchestrates the data pipeline tasks.
   - Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
   - Ensures reliability and fault tolerance in data processing workflows.

2. **Kibana**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for data visualization and exploration.
   - Generates interactive dashboards and visualizations based on analyzed customer demographic data.
   - Enables real-time monitoring and analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Usage

To utilize the project:

1. **Setup Apache Airflow**:
   - Install and configure Apache Airflow.
   - Define Airflow DAGs for the data pipeline tasks, including data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.

2. **Configure Data Sources**:
   - Connect Apache Airflow to the data sources containing customer demographic data.
   - Ensure proper data access and permissions are configured.

3. **Implement Data Visualization with Kibana**:
   - Configure Kibana to connect to the data source where customer demographic data is stored.
   - Create visualizations and dashboards in Kibana to analyze and explore the data effectively.

4. **Monitor and Iterate**:
   - Continuously monitor the performance of the data pipeline and visualizations in Kibana.
   - Iterate and refine workflows, visualizations, and analyses based on insights gained from the data.

## Conclusion

The Online Food Delivery Analysis project leverages Apache Airflow and Kibana to construct a robust data pipeline and create insightful visualizations for analyzing customer demographic data. By optimizing operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and driving business growth through data-driven decision-making, the project aims to enable online food delivery services to thrive in a competitive market landscape.
